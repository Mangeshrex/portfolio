<h1 id="why-do-i-use-void-linux">why do I use void linux</h1>
<h2 id="not-much-of-a-theoretical-answer">not much of a theoretical
answer</h2>
<p>so, most of my frens must be knowing that I am a guy who was a
archlinux lover in my beginner days. I was totally a “Btw i use arch”
guy. and now I am a peaceful void linux user. the reason behind me using
void linux from almost a year is <del>the logo</del> its minimal. It
fulfills all of my needs. I like being minimal in hand with
productivity.</p>
<h1 id="theoretical-answers">Theoretical Answers</h1>
<h2 id="updates.">UPDATES.</h2>
<p>Void linux and Arch Linux both of them are rolling release distros,
both of them always have a hell lotta updates everytime. But void
provides me the freedom to partially update my system according to my
needs. I dont update for months, whenever I am having any dependency
issue or some of my important package releases a update which is
important for me, I update that particular package.</p>
<p>But incase of arch If I do not update it for only for some 1-2
month’s it’ll start acting hella weird.</p>
<h2 id="package-manager">Package Manager</h2>
<p><del>pacman -Syu</del> &amp;&amp; <del>xbps-install -u</del></p>
<p>most of the people think that xbps-install is just too big to write.
I totally agree upon that but its not a reason to shift. I’ve set alias
for all of them include xbps-updates, xbps-install, xbps-remove,
xbps-reconfigure, xbps-fetch, xbps-query. Xbps is faster than pacman as
i’ve experienced.</p>
<h2 id="older-kernel-versions.">Older Kernel Versions.</h2>
<p><img src="../img/xq.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>as you can see in the screenshot above, you’ll find older linux
kernel packages too. Void repo doesnt remove the older versions of linux
kernel, so if a user feelsv that he is not able to be stable at the
current version he can shift to older kernel too.</p>
<h2 id="less-packages">less packages</h2>
<p>but they are enough for a man of culture.</p>
<p><em>ill always keep adding my thoughts along with time</em>.</p>
