        I am a Computer and Linux Enthusiast. I like learning new things and trying different stuff in my day to day life. I am currently studying Computer Engineering. I am also a classical music learner. I learn to code most of the time, and like hovering around my system. I started doing linux stuff back in 2020 when lockdown started due to <strong>Covid-19</strong> . I do a bit of editing work for my youtube channel, and have even tried to make my hands dirty with designing shit.
        I am also the core team member of cybernity.group<br>
        <br>
        I use <strong><i>Void/Arch linux</i></strong> as my daily driver with <strong>BSPWM</strong> as my window manager. You can steal my dotfiles in my github account but <strong>NO KANGS!!</strong> gimme credits xD.
